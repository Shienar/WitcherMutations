	This mod implements an additional accessory system inspired by the mutagens and mutations present in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. 

	There are eight types of mutagens that can drop from enemies in various biomes.
		- Blue mutagens increase mana and magic damage. They drop in the glowing mushroom biome.
		- Yellow mutagens increase ranged damage and drop in the desert.
		- White mutagens increase summon damage and drop in the ice biome.
		- Red mutagens increase melee damage and drop in the evil biomes.
		- Orange mutagens increases damage done by all classes, and it drops in hell.
		- Pink mutagens increase movement speed and drop in the hallow.
		- Green mutagens increase max health and drop in the jungle.
		- Gray mutagens reduce damage taken and drop in the caverns.

	Mutagens come in three different strengths
		- Lesser mutagens can drop at any time.
		- Regular mutagens can drop in hardmode. They can be crafted from three lesser mutagens with an orichalcum/mythril anvil.
		- Greater mutagens can drop after golem has been defeated. They can be crafted from three regular mutagens at an ancient manipulator.

	The following mutations can be crafted using greater mutagens at an ancient manipulator.
		- Sorcerer's Wrath: When you hit an enemy with a magic attack, you have a 25% chance to create an explosion that deals 50% of the original damage in a 5 tile radius.

		- Perfect Shot: All ranged attacks will home in onto the nearest target.

		- Lightning Reflexes: Slows down enemy movement by 15%.
		- Unstoppable: Upon reaching zero health, instead restore 20% health and become immune to damage for 4 seconds. (180s cooldown).
